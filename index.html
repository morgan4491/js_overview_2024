    <h2 id="time">Time: 10</h2>

    <button id="start-btn">Start Timer</button>

    <button id="reset-btn">Reset Timer</button>

    <p>Press the 'S' key on your keyboard to start the timer</p>
    <p>Press the 'R' key on your keyboard to reset the timer</p>

    <!-- 
        Create another button to reset the timer
        
        In your JS, you'll need to make sure that you clear the interval when the reset button is clicked

        You'll also need to reset all of the respective variables back to their initial values

        BONUS
        Create a button that simply stops the timer and the start timer button will start it again
